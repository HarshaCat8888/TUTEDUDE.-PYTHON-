# Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

# Taking integer input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Using if-else to check even or odd
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is an even number")
else:
    print(f"{number} is an odd number")


 # Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

# Initialize total sum
total = 0

# Loop from 1 to 50 and add each number to total
for i in range(1, 51):
    total += i

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is {total}")
