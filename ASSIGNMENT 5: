# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

# Step 1: Create a dictionary with student names and their marks
student_marks = {
    "Alice": 85,
    "Bob": 78,
    "Charlie": 92,
    "Diana": 88
}

# Step 2: Ask the user to input a student's name
name = input("Enter the student's name: ")

# Step 3: Retrieve and display the marks or show a message if not found
if name in student_marks:
    print(f"{name}'s marks:{student_marks[name]}")
else:
    print("Student not found")


# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Step 2: Extract the first five elements
extracted = numbers[:5]

# Step 3: Reverse the extracted elements
reversed_extracted = extracted[::-1]

# Step 4: Print all lists
print("Original list:", numbers)
print("Extracted first five elements:", extracted)
print("Reversed extracted elements:", reversed_extracted)
