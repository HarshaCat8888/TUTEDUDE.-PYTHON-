# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Taking input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Performing operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2

# Handling division by zero
if num2 != 0:
    division = num1 / num2
else:
    division = "Undefined (division by zero)"

# Displaying results
print("\nResults:")
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)


# Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting
# Taking input from the user
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")
# Concatenating full name
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# Displaying the personalized greeting
print(f"\nHello, {full_name}! Welcome to the Python program.")
