# Task 1:  
# Basic Mathematical Operations

# Take two numbers as input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform basic mathematical operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2

# Handle division carefully to avoid division by zero
if num2 != 0:
    division = num1 / num2
else:
    division = "Undefined (cannot divide by zero)"

# Display the results
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)



# Task 2 :
# Personalized Greeting Program

# Take user's first and last name as input
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")

# Concatenate to form the full name
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# Print personalized greeting
print("\nHello,", full_name, "! Welcome to the Python program.")
